# Lumina Engine
Developing an OpenGL-based rendering engine while learning basic concepts from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/). This project aims to build a [physically based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) rendering (PBR) engine which ultimately does [path tracing](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/).
